### <a href="http://www.asutoshcollege.in/">ASUTOSH COLLEGE</a> <br> Dept. Computer Sc. <br> CMSA, Part - II, Software Assignment

###	Number Theory Based

(2). Write a C program so that for all integers I, J, K, L from 1 to 1000. Find and prints all combination of I, J, K and L such that I + J + K = L and I < J < K < L. Example: I=1, J=2, K=3, l=6. Here 1<2<3<6.

1(5). Convert a decimal number to its equivalent binary, Octal and Hexadecimal and vice-versa.

2(8). Write a program, which will ask to enter two set of integers. Then perform the following set operations<br>
   a. Intersection.<br>
   b. Union.<br>
   c. Minus.
   
3(11). Write a program to evaluate the range of data types in C language. Example: For Character the range is –127 to +128.

###	Elementary Algebra Based

4(15). Find L.C.M and H.C.F of numbers.

5(18). Write a program to read three positive numbers A, B, C and determine whether the number can form sides of triangle. If yes determine whether the triangle is an acute angle triangle. Determine in addition whether is an equilateral triangle, an isosceles triangle.

6(21). Write a C program to show the permutation of  nPr no of items (Characters).

###	Matrix Algebra Based
	
7(25). Find the determinant of a matrix.

8(28). Write a program for multiplication of matrix (Provide necessary conditions for validity checking).

###	Numerical Analysis Based
	
9(33). Write a program to compute the real roots of the following non linear equation by Newton-Raphson method: x^3 - 4x + 1 = 0. Correct up to 5 significant digits.

(36). Write a program to find the linear simultaneous equations by Camers Rule.

10(39). Write a program for matrix inversion method.

###	String Based

11(42). Write a program to print a normal input string diagonally where each character in the output will be in uppercase form. Example: The string “Bat” will be printed as<br>
...B<br>
....A<br>
.....T

12(45). Write a program to search a pattern from a text by K. M. P (Knuth-Moris-Pat) algorithm.

13(48). Write a program to sort (by ascending order) a set of string. Use command line argument.

###	Graph Theory Based

14(51). Write a program to find the minimum spanning tree of a given weighted graph using Prim’s algorithm.

15(54). Write a program to find the degree of each vertex in a given graph.

16(57). Write a progrm to implement shortest path algorithm for finding the shortest path within a pair of vertices of a graph.

###	Data Structure Based
	
17(62). Rearrange a set of given numbers in ascending or descending order by Bubble sort method.

18(65). Write a C program to implement Quick Sort.

19(68). Write a program to build a binary search tree having characters as the content of each node. Visit the created tree in preorder, inorder and postorder sequence. Display the output in suitable format.

20(72). Implements polynomials using linked list and perform the following operations using menu driven function:<br>
    a. Add two polynomials.<br>
    b. Multiply two polynomials.

21(75). Write a menu driven program in C to implement a circular queue using linked list incorporating the following items:
    a. Adding elements to cqueue<br>
    b. Deleting from cqueue<br>
    c. Display the cqueue<br>
    d. Quit

22(78). Implement the stack using menu driven program. Stack should be implement by linked structure.

23(81). Write a program to perform Insertion, Deletion in to a Binary Search Tree.

###	Data File Based
	
(85). Write a C program that prints a list of all distinct words in a text file and for each word also print the list of line numbers in which it occurs. If a word appears more than once in a particular line then print the line number only once for that word.

24(88). Write a c program that accepts three text files(say f1,f2,f3) as command line arguments and merge lines alternately from two files ‘f1’ and ‘f2’ and writes the results into the third file ‘f3’. If one of the two files is finished earlier the remaining lines from the larger file will be simply copied to the third file ‘f3’. Finally print all the three files.

###	Application Based
	
(93). Write a program to generate the following pattern<br>
....1..........1<br>
....1.2....2.1<br>
....1.2.3.2.1<br>
....1.2....2.1<br>
....1..........1<br>
  (The highest number within the pattern will be given at the run time. Here this is 3)

(96). Generate all possible integers by arranging three given integers from 1 to 100 and sort them in ascending order.

(99). Write a program to implement a very small dictionary. (Use a text file for data)<br>
    Example: Input: Teacher<br>
    Output: A person who teach something.
    
(102). W.A.P. which converts numbers in the decimal system to Roman numerals with the following notations:<br>
     X = 10,    L = 50,    C = 100,     D = 500,    M = 1000<br>
     XIV = 14,      CCXXI = 231,      MDXXI =1521
